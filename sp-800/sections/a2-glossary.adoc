== Glossary

////
Include a separate glossary if the document includes a substantial number of terms that need defining.

Remember to check the online glossary, https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary, for existing terminology. Try to use existing terms and definitions as-is, if at all possible.

Glossary appendixes are marked up in AsciiDoc like Terms & Definitions sections elsewhere in Metanorma:
each term consitutes a subsection
////

=== Term 1
Definition

=== Term 2
Definitin

=== Term 3
Definition
