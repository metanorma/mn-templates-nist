The NIST Library has developed a reference style for NIST Technical Series publications, based on the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS) reference style. Its use is strongly encouraged, but not required (except in articles for the NIST Journal of Research (JRES). For more information, including links to downloadable styles (EndNote, Mendeley, Zotero and BibTeX) for several reference management applications, see https://inet.nist.gov/library/publishing-support-nist-publications/nist-technical-series-publications/reference-format. To get a copy of a reference management application, see https://inet.nist.gov/library/publishing-support-nist-publications/managing-references.

The following references are examples. If you are creating a reference that is not addressed by the NIST style, then 1) be as consistent as possible with your other references, and 2) provide information that will enable the reader to uniquely (and easily) identify that reference.

Use either a numeric [1] or alphanumeric [SP 800-37] format. Arrange numeric references by number; arrange alphanumeric references by the reference itself. Do not arrange either type of list by author or other information in the detailed citation.

In Metanorma, references are given as `* [[[internal-id,document-code]], Reference`. The internal-id is how citations are generated, as cross-references (e..g `<<ref1>>`). The document code is a number, for numeric citations, and the document identifier, for alphanumeric citations. Metanorma attempts to fetch document identifiers it recognizes as standards from online repositories, with the latest text supplanting the included citation. For that reason, any document identifiers that are normally prefixed with "NIST" should be given with that prefix as their document identifier (e.g. `NIST SP 800-187`, not `SP 800-187`; the `NIST` prefix will be stripped in the generated citation on rendering.)
