Comment 1: TITLE (:title-main:)

When filling out the NIST-114 Form in NIKE, the Title field should only contain the Title (and Subtitle, if present) exactly as it appears on the Title Page of the publication. DO NOT include other information, such as publication number, in that field.
////

////
Comment 2: AUTHORSHIP (:fullname:, :affiliation:, :address:)

For guidance on authorship, see NIST Directive G 5201.01, Guidance for Authorship of Scholarly and Technical Publications.https://inet.nist.gov/directives/guidance-authorship-scholarly-technical-publications

Author Order and Grouping. Attributes for each author after the first are indicated by suffixing _2, _3 etc. to the attribute label. Always identify the primary author/creator first (s/he does not have to be a NIST author). Repeat the affliation information for each author: the Metanorma tool will group authors automatically. The organizational groupings and the names within each grouping should generally be ordered by decreasing level of contribution.

For non-NIST authors, list their city and state using the `:address:` attribute.

For NIST authors, include the Division and Laboratory names using the `:affiliation:` attribute (but do not include their city and state using the `:address:` attribute).

For example:

:fullname: Sara Lee
:affiliation: ACME Security Corp.
:address: New York, NY

:fullname_2: John Smith
:affiliation_2: Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory

:fullname_3: Jane Doe
:affiliation_3: Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory

:fullname_4: Joe Jones
:affiliation_4: Department of Homeland Security
:address_4: Washington, DC

:fullname_5: Barbara Carpenter
:affiliation_5: Department of Homeland Security
:address_5: Washington, DC

I.e., Sara Lee was the primary author. ITL authors collectively contributed more than the DHS authors, and John Smith contributed relatively more than Jane Doe, etc.
////

////
Comment 3: REPORT NUMBERS (:docnumber:)

CSWP are not currently assigned distinct identifiers: White Papers are identified through their date of publication (`:issued-date:`).
////

////
Comment 4: DOCUMENT EMAIL (:doc-email:)

Include if there is an email alias associated with this publication or program.

Request an Alias. Send an email request to alias@nist.gov that includes:
1. the name of the email address you want (e.g., security_pub@nist.gov); and
2. the target address(es) where you want emails redirected.
////

////
Comment 5: KEYWORDS (:keywords:)

Consider terms that someone might use when searching. Keywords should help increase the findability of a publication beyond the words in the Title and Abstract. Selecting appropriate keywords helps users locate the publication when searching on the Internet or in specialized databases (e.g., NIST Publication Portal, IEEExplore, Google Scholar, etc.).

Guidance for selecting Keywords:

*	Avoid overkill -- use 10 or fewer keywords, if possible;
*	Choose words, terms or phrases that give a clear and precise indication to the general reader of pertinent subjects covered in the publication;
*	*** Consider the words or phrases that a user might search on;
*	Include the obvious, but try not to simply repeat words from the Title and Abstract;
*	List the research areas, the general type of study, or the general class of processes examined;
*	Identify the specific problem and the method used;
*	Indicate the type of results reported;
*	Include synonyms;
*	Remember that the potential reader may not be an expert on this topic!
*	Don't agonize over trying to select the "perfect" keywords!
////

////
Comment 8: Retired drafts (:circulated-date:, :abandoned-date:, :bib-additional-note:)

If a draft is retired, the cover page of the draft will display when the draft was first published (:circulated-date:),
when work on the draft was abandoned (:abandoned-date:), and optionally a note with additional information
(:bib-additional-note:). The attributes :circulated-date: and :abandoned-date: must be provided with any
retired draft.
////

////
Comment 9: Withdrawn drafts and publications (:circulated-date:, :issued-date:, :obsoleted-date:, :superseded-date:,
:revdate:, :obsoleted-by:,
:superseding-status:, :superseding-iteration:, :superseding-title:, :superseding-subtitle:,
:superseding-circulated-date:, :superseding-doi:, :superseding-url:, :bib-additional-note:, :bib-withdrawal-note:,
:bib-withdrawal-announcement-link:, :nist-division:)

If a draft is withdrawn, meaning that it is superseded by the next stage in the document production process,
the cover page will display information about the document superseding it. This information must be
provided as document attributes: :circulated-date: (when this draft was first published),
:obsoleted-date: (the date on which this draft was superseded),
the various :superseding- attributes, and optionally a note with additional information
(:bib-additional-note:).

If a published document is withdrawn, meaning that it is superseded by another document,
the cover page will display information about the document superseding it. This information must be
provided as document attributes:

* :published-date: (when this document was first authorised to be published),
* :superseded-date: (the date on when the transition period started, during which both
documents were in effect, if applicable; if not, this has the same value as :obsoleted-date:)
* :obsoleted-date: (the date on which this draft was superseded),
* :bib-additional-note: (a note with additional information; "Related Information" in the withdrawn document coverpage)
* :bib-withdrawal-note: (a note on the withdrawal of the publication)
* :bib-withdrawal-announcement-link: (a link to the announcement of the withdrawal of the publication)
* :nist-division: (the division of NIST responsible for the publication)
* :revdate: (for when the withdrawal notice was added to the document)

If information about the superseding document is available from the CSRC
website, it can be retrieved by giving the identifier of the superseding document, as
:obsoleted-by:. If that information is not available from the CSRC website, the identifier of the superseding document
needs to be accompanied by bibliographic information provided through the various :superseding- attributes.

Comment 10: SPONSOR (:sponsor:, :sponsor-logo:)

Sponsorship.  If the publication was sponsored by another organization (e.g., SP 800-124), contact Jim Foti to determine how sponsorship should be represented on the Cover and Title Pages. An example can be found at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.1658.
