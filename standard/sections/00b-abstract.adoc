[abstract]
== Abstract

Include a brief abstract of the document.  This can be the same text that is used in the NIST-114 form in NIKE. Any acronyms should be spelled out on first use (e.g., "Personal Identity Verification (PIV)..."). Avoid including references in this abstract.
Guidance for writing Abstracts: 

*	Rule of thumb: limit to 200 words or less;
*	Address the following questions:
**	What *problem* was examined or what procedure was carried out?
**	What was the *objective* of the activity being documented?
**	What was the *scope* of the activity?
**	What were the *principal conclusions and recommendations*?
*	Use complete sentences;
*	Acronyms: spell out upon first occurrence;
*	Avoid unnecessary contractions or abbreviations;
*	Avoid using equations and tables; and
*	Avoid using "this draft" in the Abstract, for it can be easily overlooked when the final version is published
