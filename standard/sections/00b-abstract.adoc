== Abstract

This recommendation provides a technical guideline to use Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) Cards in facility access; enabling
federal agencies to operate as government-wide interoperable
enterprises. These guidelines cover the risk-based strategy to
select appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms as expressed
within Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201.
