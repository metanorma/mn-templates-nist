Comment 1: TITLE (:title-main:)

When filling out the NIST-114 Form in NIKE, the Title field should only contain the Title (and Subtitle, if present) exactly as it appears on the Title Page of the publication. DO NOT include other information, such as publication number, in that field.
////

////
Comment 2: AUTHORSHIP (:fullname:, :affiliation:, :address:)

For guidance on authorship, see NIST Directive G 5201.01, Guidance for Authorship of Scholarly and Technical Publications.https://inet.nist.gov/directives/guidance-authorship-scholarly-technical-publications 

Author Order and Grouping. Attributes for each author after the first are indicated by suffixing _2, _3 etc. to the attribute label. Always identify the primary author/creator first (s/he does not have to be a NIST author). Repeat the affliation information for each author: the Metanorma tool will group authors automatically. The organizational groupings and the names within each grouping should generally be ordered by decreasing level of contribution.

For non-NIST authors, list their city and state using the `:address:` attribute.

For NIST authors, include the Division and Laboratory names using the `:affiliation:` attribute (but do not include their city and state using the `:address:` attribute).

For example:

:fullname: Sara Lee
:affiliation: ACME Security Corp.
:address: New York, NY

:fullname_2: John Smith
:affiliation_2: Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory

:fullname_3: Jane Doe
:affiliation_3: Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory

:fullname_4: Joe Jones
:affiliation_4: Department of Homeland Security
:address_4: Washington, DC

:fullname_5: Barbara Carpenter
:affiliation_5: Department of Homeland Security
:address_5: Washington, DC

I.e., Sara Lee was the primary author. ITL authors collectively contributed more than the DHS authors, and John Smith contributed relatively more than Jane Doe, etc.
////

Comment 3: SPONSOR (:sponsor:, :sponsor-logo:)

Sponsorship.  If the publication was sponsored by another organization (e.g., SP 800-124), contact Jim Foti to determine how sponsorship should be represented on the Cover and Title Pages. An example can be found at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.1658.  
////

////
Comment 3: REPORT NUMBERS (:docnumber:)

A report number may be issued by the NIST Information Services Office (NIST ISO) if: a) a draft will be posted for public comment, or b) a sponsoring agency needs the publication to have a number. 

Email the TITLE and PRIMARY AUTHOR POINT OF CONTACT to Jim Foti, jfoti@nist.gov. He will request a number from NIST ISO, and will CC you (and Liz Lennon in the ITL Lab Office) on that correspondence.

Otherwise, if the publication is NOT being posted for comment, it will be assigned a number upon final publication by NIST ISO (i.e., after WERB approval).

When filling out Form NIST-114 in NIKE, if a publication number has been issued, or it is a revision of a previously published document, include the publication number in the "Supplementary Information" field, as "Pre-assigned number: xxxxx"
